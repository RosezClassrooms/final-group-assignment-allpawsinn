# Group-Assignment
This is the final group assignment for the semester. For this assignment you are required to use two design patterns that were covered post midterm.

They can be used in two separate problems, on using each, or in the same problem that require both.

Please select a problem/problems that are managable with regards to successful implementation.
When submitting your repository, please edit this readMe file to clearly describe the applications you have designed and mention what patterns you have chosen to you for them.


#patterns
We chose strategy and command patterns

#strategy pattern
In a busy period, it is very important for students and teachers to keep their anxiety, health, nutrition,rest and efficiency levels under control. Just keeping these levels under control is not enough, keeping the levels in control while working on the lessons should be done on time for the assignments. In this direction, we decided to write a program that allows students to choose a strategy to finish their assignments on time according to the levels we have just mentioned. To do this, we needed algorithms that student could select during run-time. That's why we decided to use strategy pattern. With the help of Strategy pattern, we created algorithm families in order for students to work more efficiently in their lessons.

#command pattern
Coronavirus Pandemic has changed our life for almost one year, and it brought many problems in our life, especially to public places like stores, cafes, etc. Letting too much customer into stores could be dangerous for everyone in the store, to prevent that stores should monitor the customer count and make a limitation, to resolve that problem we implemented a python program that counts customers in a store by adding, or substracting every customer, and opens or closes light according to command. We implemented that program by using command pattern since it suits perfect to our problem.


 
#Instructions
in order to run different pattern these run command can be copy and paste to .replit

run = "python3 strategy_patern.py"
run = "python3 store_command.py"
