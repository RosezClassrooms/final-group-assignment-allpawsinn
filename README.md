# Group-Assignment
This is the final group assignment for the semester. For this assignment you are required to use two design patterns that were covered post midterm.

They can be used in two separate problems, on using each, or in the same problem that require both.

Please select a problem/problems that are managable with regards to successful implementation.
When submitting your repository, please edit this readMe file to clearly describe the applications you have designed and mention what patterns you have chosen to you for them.


#patterns
We chose builder and facade patterns

#builder pattern
For the builder pattern, we assumed we are car retailer and to provide customers to better service we preapared a program that is responsible for creating cars in different circumstances.For example, if customer wants to buy Racing car, he/she can customize the car with a few options like brand, horse power, engine, color etc.

#facade pattern
For the facade pattern, we implemented a computer system platform that have the main components in the pc, CPU, GPU, RAM and Power Supply. Our system simulates a PC that you can start it, boost the components' frequency, print the results and if the existing power supply is not enough to run the PC. You can change the PSU in order to build a fully functional PC.

#Note to Professor
 Before you cancelled the strategy pattern homework, we were completed it. If you can check it we did it right or not, it would be so benefical.
 
#Instructions
in order to run different pattern these run command can be copy and paste to .replit
run = "python3 car_builder.py"
run = "python3 pc_facade.py"
run = "python3 strategy_patern.py"
